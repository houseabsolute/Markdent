0.02

- Fixed some cases of nested strong and em in the Standard dialect's
  parser. It was broken for cases like this:

  *This **is a test***.

  This should turn into HTML like

  <em>This <strong>is a test</strong></em>

  but instead turned into

  <em>This</em> <em>is a test</em>*.

- Added some missing test dependencies.

- There is now a separate class for each type of event, all of which do the
  Markdent::Role::Event role.

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world. Still rather alpha, and
  internals are subject to lots of change.
